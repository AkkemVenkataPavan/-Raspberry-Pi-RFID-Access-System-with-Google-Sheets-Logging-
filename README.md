# -Raspberry-Pi-RFID-Access-System-with-Google-Sheets-Logging-
This project implements an RFID-based access control system using a Raspberry Pi and an MFRC522 RFID reader. It logs each card scan attempt (whether access is granted or denied) directly into a Google Sheet using Google Apps Script Webhooks.
